"""Tests for `_filter_upstream_logs` — strip PiAPI retry chatter from the
surfaced `remote_logs`.

PiAPI's task `data.logs` is passed through to the block UI verbatim. It
includes retry mechanics ("Attempt N failed, retrying"), transient errors it
retried away (5xx), and a benign "invalid duration, use '5' as default" note
that we trigger by intentionally omitting `duration` for VIP+video runs. The
user wants only substantive outcome lines — the final failure already surfaces
via the job error/status — so the noise is dropped.
